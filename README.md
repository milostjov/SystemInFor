# SystemInFor

**SystemInFor** is a Windows service developed in C# (.NET Framework 4.6.1) designed for automated system maintenance, such as remote restarts, session monitoring, and background operations. It works alongside a secondary executable, **Helper.exe**, which runs in the user session to perform tasks that cannot be executed directly by the service.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Runs as a Windows Service with system-level privileges
- Communicates with `Helper.exe` to monitor active user sessions
- Automatically installs and starts via **Inno Setup** installer
- Suitable for controlled environments with multiple client machines

## üß± Technologies

- **Language:** C#
- **Framework:** .NET Framework 4.6.1
- **Project Type:** Windows Service
- **Installer:** Inno Setup

## üöÄ Installation

The application is installed using a pre-configured **Inno Setup** script located in the `installer/` folder.

### üß∞ Steps:

1. Build both `SystemInFor` and `Helper` projects in **Release mode**
2. Copy both `SystemInFor.exe` and `Helper.exe` into a common folder (e.g., `build/`)
3. Open the `installer/SystemInFor.iss` file using [Inno Setup Compiler](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php)
4. Compile the script to generate the installer:  
   üì¶ `SystemInForInstaller.exe`
5. Run the installer as Administrator

## üì¶ Inno Setup Highlights

The installer performs the following tasks:

- Copies both `SystemInFor.exe` and `Helper.exe` to the installation directory
- Installs the Windows service using `InstallUtil.exe`
- Starts the service
- Registers `Helper.exe` to auto-run on user login via the registry

#### Example (simplified from script):

```ini
[Files]
Source: "SystemInFor.exe"; DestDir: "{app}"
Source: "Helper.exe"; DestDir: "{app}"

[Run]
Filename: "InstallUtil.exe"; Parameters: "/i \"{app}\SystemInFor.exe\""
Filename: "sc"; Parameters: "start SystemInForm"
Filename: "reg"; Parameters: "... add Helper.exe to HKCU Run"
```

Uninstalling the application will:
- Stop and uninstall the service
- Remove registry entries for `Helper.exe`

## üîÑ Uninstallation

Uninstallation is handled automatically by the installer:

- Stops and deletes the Windows service
- Removes the registry key for auto-starting `Helper.exe`

You can also uninstall via:
```bash
Add or Remove Programs ‚Üí SystemInForService
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Requirements

- Administrator privileges required for installation
- Both `SystemInFor.exe` and `Helper.exe` must be present in the same directory
- .NET Framework 4.6.1 must be installed on the target machine
