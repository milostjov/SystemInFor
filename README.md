# SystemInFor

**SystemInFor** is a Windows service developed in C# (.NET Framework) that performs system-related tasks such as restarting the system under certain conditions. It is designed to work independently without a GUI and is intended to be installed and run as a service.

## Features

- Monitors the system and performs automated restart when required.
- Designed to run silently in the background as a Windows Service.
- Includes an installer via `ProjectInstaller.cs` for easy service registration.

## Project Structure

```
SystemInFor/
â”œâ”€â”€ Program.cs             # Entry point of the service
â”œâ”€â”€ ProjectInstaller.cs    # Handles installation logic for the Windows service
â”œâ”€â”€ Service1.cs            # Core service logic implementation
â”œâ”€â”€ SystemInFor.csproj     # C# project file
â”œâ”€â”€ app.config             # Configuration file

Root Directory:
â”œâ”€â”€ SystemInFor.sln        # Visual Studio solution file
â””â”€â”€ README.md              # Project documentation
```

## How It Works

1. The service is installed using `installutil.exe` or similar tools.
2. Once started, it runs in the background and executes logic defined in `Service1.cs`.
3. It can be configured to run automatically on system startup.

## Installation

1. Open the solution in Visual Studio and build it.
2. Open Command Prompt as Administrator and run:
   ```bash
   installutil SystemInFor.exe
   ```
3. Start the service via `services.msc` or with:
   ```bash
   net start SystemInFor
   ```

## Notes

- You may need to unblock the executable or adjust service permissions.
- Ensure `.NET Framework` is installed on the target system.

## Companion Application (Helper.exe)

SystemInFor relies on a companion application named `Helper.exe`, which is hosted in a separate repository. While the Windows service runs in the system context, `Helper.exe` is executed within the user's session and performs tasks that require user-level access, such as:

- Detecting the currently logged-in user
- Monitoring active foreground windows
- Notifying the service about session-related changes

You can find the `Helper.exe` source and build instructions here:

Ensure `Helper.exe` is launched at user login (e.g., via Task Scheduler, startup folder, or registry key).
